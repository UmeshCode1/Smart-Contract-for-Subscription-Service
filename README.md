# 💼 Smart Contract for Subscription Services

## 📜 Project Description

This is a decentralized **Ethereum smart contract** built by **Umesh Patel**, designed to enable seamless subscription-based services. Users can subscribe by paying a fixed fee, and the smart contract automatically manages and verifies each user’s subscription duration securely and transparently.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

To revolutionize digital subscriptions by removing third-party middlemen and enabling **secure, transparent, and automated** subscription systems using **blockchain technology**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 Secure payments using Ethereum
- 📆 Tracks individual user subscription time
- 👑 Owner-only withdrawal rights (Umesh controls contract funds)
- 🌍 Open to any Ethereum user for subscription access

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- ⏳ Auto-renewable subscriptions with timers
- 📊 Tiered pricing models (e.g., Basic, Pro, Premium)
- 🔗 Oracle integration for live data interaction
- 🔔 Renewal reminders and push/email notifications
- 🪙 Token-based rewards, loyalty points, and referral discounts
